# Hospital-Information-System

Enable typical hospital flow
  a. Patient registers, reviewed at OP, referred for admission (IP)
  b. Nurses and residents in the ward manage patient - can view and add records,
  including images
  c. Doctor/consultant performs “rounds”, views data on tablet. Reviews and updates data
  and treatment plan. Usability is key
2. Only nurses/residents on duty can access records. Similarly primary doc
and those who have treated patient can access records
3. Pharmacy can view prescriptions
4. Patient and/or authorized persons can provide consent for data sharing
5. *Look at various ways to make doctor app usable - including voice input
